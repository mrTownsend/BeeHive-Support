Decancer contains both Decancering tools and Dehoisting tools, to prevent users from artificially hoisting themselves by using corrupted or special character in their name. This also helps patch vulnerabilities connected with special character exploits, client-side crashes, and text exploits.&#x20;

Commands are as follows:

<details>

<summary><code>[p]decancer</code></summary>

Remove special/cancerous characters from user nicknames

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>[p]decancerset</code></summary>

Configure automatic dehoisting and decancering

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>[p]dehoist</code></summary>

Manually request a memberlist scan to bring it within compliance.&#x20;
