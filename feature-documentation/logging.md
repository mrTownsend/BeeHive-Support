# ðŸ’¬ Logging

Logging helps you and your users keep track of anything happening in your server, including message deletions and edits, role changes, server changes, channel changes, invite changes, and more. To enable logging, let's do the following:



1. Create a channel called `#logging`. You can realistically call the channel whatever you want, but I recommend logging.&#x20;
2. Type `[p]modlogset modlog #channel`
3. Type `[p]modlog all true`

That's literally it! Logging is active in the specified channel and will start as soon as there are events for it to log. Simple, but effective.&#x20;
