# ðŸ—ƒ Data Management

This document exists to inform you of the ways that your data is either processed, used, or stored. If a feature is not listed here, you can safely presume it is not storing your data in any active way as of this website being live. This website will be updated over time to change based on what data is being used where.&#x20;

<summary><code>General Data Collected and Stored</code></summary>

BeeHive creates a user profile to store your personal settings for certain features, such as background profiles for leveling, or playlists for audio. This does not contain any personally identifiable information. BeeHive temporarily caches your messages in individual servers, only accessable to staff members in the server. This is to allow monitoring and moderative investigation. BeeHive caches new information about servers it joins, such as if they've been in discovery before, if they're a large server, how many members/roles/emojis/channels they have, and more. If you verify with a server using EmailVerification, BeeHive stores your email globally, only accessable to BeeHive Staff for verification and customer support. BeeHive may additionally send you emails to verify you are a human in order for EmailVerification to work. The list of reasons BeeHive may use your data is subject to change at any time, but the bottom line is that with best practices in mind your data will always go towards a secure, helpful use in the development of the bot.&#x20;

<summary><code>If Chat Analysis is Enabled</code></summary>

BeeHive will submit a copy of all message content to the PerspectiveAPI and take action based on the results. There is no way to opt out of this, this is server moderation preference and not user preference. Users are notified when they join a server of these terms and information, and they should not continue to use a server that has BeeHive in it if they do not agree with this, in order to avoid a conflict of interests. Users are only notified **once** per server they join, in case BeeHive's Privacy Policy or Terms of Service have updated. If the user has previously joined the server and rejoins, they will not be sent a message to avoid this being taken as DM Abuse/Bot Spamming.

There is no way to opt out of this, this is server moderation preference and not user preference. Users are notified when they join a server of this information, and they should not continue to use a server that has BeeHive in it if they do not agree with this, in order to avoid a conflict of interests.

<summary><code>If Invite Filtering is Enabled</code></summary>

BeeHive will cache a copy of all invites it blocks and resolve them to provide more information in the related AutoMod message.

Users who do not agree with this should not remain in servers that utilize BeeHive, to prevent a conflict of interests.

<summary><code>If a User is Globally Banned</code></summary>

BeeHive will store information on you forever, including your username as it changes, your Discord ID, your offense, the evidence, and other related data needed to enforce bans across servers. You can not request to have any of this information removed, as it is intentionally a protective tool. A copy of all of your messages will additionally be archived if you are globally banned and is never subject to timed removal. \

If you are globally banned, you may appeal via email. Contact Security at [security@beehive.systems](mailto:security@beehive.systems) for an appeal.&#x20;
