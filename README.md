# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to BeeHive!

## Initial Setup

When you first invite BeeHive to your server, it's the best practice to ensure it has **Administrator** if you intend on making it your go-to bot. I can assure you, BeeHive is a safe and trustable bot with a multitude of additional security measures and exists to make friends among those seeking shelter from harassment, toxicity, scams, phishing, and much more. To get started, you'll need to set a few things up just to cover individual modules.

## Basic Moderative Permissions

1. Set applicable admin roles with `~set addadminrole @mentionrole`
2. Set applicable mod roles with `~set addmodrule @mentionrole`

## Bot Permissions

While BeeHive does not **require** that you give it Administrator for it to work properly, you **will** more than likely run into permission errors while trying to use the bot - ESPECIALLY if you've added it to a very permissions-complex server.

As a Best Practice no matter your use of BeeHive, you should ensure it has the following permissions at all times to prevent a multitude of permission errors.

> BAN\_MEMBERS
>
> KICK\_MEMBERS
>
> TIMEOUT\_MEMBERS
>
> MANAGE\_ROLES
>
> MANAGE\_CHANNEL
>
> MANAGE\_SERVER
>
> SEND\_MESSAGES
>
> READMESSAGEHISTORY
>
> SPEAK
>
> CONNECT
>
> PRIORITY\_SPEAKER
>
> MANAGE\_EVENTS
>
> VIEW\_CHANNELS
>
> MANAGE\_EMOJI
>
> VIEW\_AUDITLOG
>
> MANAGE\_WEBHOOKS
>
> CREATE\_INVITE `REQUIRED FOR SUPPORT`
>
> CHANGE\_NICKNAME
>
> MANAGE\_NICKNAMES
>
> EMBED\_LINKS
>
> ATTACH\_FILES
>
> ADD\_REACTIONS
>
> USE\_EXTERNALEMOJI
>
> MENTION\_EVERYONE
>
> MANAGE\_MESSAGES
>
> USE\_COMMANDS
>
> MUTE\_MEMBERS
>
> DEAFEN\_MEMBERS
>
> MOVE\_MEMBERS
>
> REQUEST\_SPEAK

**ALTERNATIVELY** if you don't feel like going thru that clusterfuck of a list permission-by-permission, just give the bot Administrator and get over your paranoia.
